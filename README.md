# FrozenLake Solution

[Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) (formerly known as OpenAI Gym) provides several environments that are often used in the context of reinforcement learning.  `FrozenLake-v1` is a simple grid like environment, in which a player tries to cross a frozen lake from a starting position to a goal position. On the river are multiple holes which the player must avoid, or the episode will fail. Moreover, the problem can be made even more difficult if the actions do not lead in the intended direction (due to the slippery surface).

This repository presents some solutions to this problem.
